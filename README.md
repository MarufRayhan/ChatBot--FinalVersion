### **Project files short description**
#### **Data**
For making a chatbot it's necessary to have a large dataset according to ones domain. I had my own dataset where one column shows the queries and another coulmn displays correspondent  intents. Another data file contains intents and theie replies.
### **Data Preprocessing**
```
data_loader.py
```
This file contains all sorts of data preproceesing.For starters:Tokenization,stemming.Bag of words,lower casing.
### **Models**
I tried many models to get better accuracy for better results.For instance:
```
base_model.py
```
```
cnn_bigru.py
```
```
cnn_bilstm.py
```
```
cnn_lstm.py
```
```
tflearn.py
```
To call them I used factory method
```
factory.py
```

### **Train**
For training and prediction and results:
```
training.py
```

### **Deployment **
Run from terminal
```
python deploy.py
```
